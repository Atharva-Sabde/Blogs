# Covid19 pandemic , a boon or curse to education?

Now , its been almost an year , since Covid19 hit
We, as humans are bound to routines, also everyone was so immensely dived in their routines that, the absence of it , has rendered us anxious , helpless and with a sheer feeling of emptiness.

Yeah , it is true that internet is such a great thing , we can connect to anyone ,anywhere
in the world within seconds , but see what kind of irony this is, still we feel depressed and alone.
The thing is , the connection now is just limited to watching instagram stories and snapchats.

Education sector had also bore a major impact of Covid-19 ,Students who used to go to school/college prior to pandemic had a normal social life , and suddenly they were forced to stay between the four walls of home and on the name of school they just have a screen in their hand. But on the other hand if we look optimistically,
Virtualization is great for education ,also it is not ? it also has a negative effect on student's minds.How? We must not forget the exceptional kids who need constant help and motivation to learn/study. Yes learning is great and content available online is resource rich ,but anyhow it is not making much difference for these kids.

We in India , used to have an ancient education system called as gurukuls , they primarily focused on practical street skills , rather than book skills.You may call it orthdox but it actually made sense back then. It was later replaced by our current (western) education system, which somehow did its job.
BUT!...
When covid came into picture ,all these things were about to change.
"Pandemic forced everyone to get online"
earlier only few people(students) had access to internet and even if they had , their primary source of education was not the internet.Also using online resources was a choice , and there were always options like offline tutions and classes.

Now when online education has normalized after an year , there are two sides to this situation...

Firstly , the normal people who adapted this , will always be on a better privilliged side as they can learn much more things through online resources. Without getting into the hassle of submissions of assignments and stuff.

Secondly: the people who belong to minorities in rural areas! yes what about them?
recently , our country somehow managed to hike up the literacy rate in rural areas to match with urban cities , with the help of rural education improvement schemes and Govt schools.
These are the people who are going to bear a huge impact , because they don't have access to abudant resources like us! Poor internet connection is going to be one of the major issues. Befor moving on to combined future of indian education system , we will have to fix this issue first.

Apps and services like Byjus ,and extramarks exist, but we will need to centralise these discrete systems so as to minimalize the unfair effects. And how can we forget Youtube? it's content has increased in terms of quality and quantity as well, that too free of cost! if you could bear annoying ads;)
Today there is no such skill which can't be learnt on youtube , be it programming tutorials or cricket tips or cooking instructions.Till today every student lived under monopoly of these so called Educational institutions,
but now thing are going to change for sure!
Also one thing is certain , The youth of India has started to step on the tracks of Autodidacticism.
Self learning is the future!
